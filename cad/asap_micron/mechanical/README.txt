The big hole in the camera is for a "C mount lens".  My understanding
that the spec for this is 1" 32 TPI UN2A.

Tolerances: I've used three decimals for any dimensions where there
may be a fit issue.  I've used standard clearance holes for paired bolts,
so I don't think any special care should be required for the tapped
holes or clearance holes.

I think the most critical position is the hole pairs for the alignment
dowel pins between the camera and bar parts.  The idea is that the
pins should slip fit in the camera body and press fit in the bar.

Hole sizes should generally be standard drill sizes, and are not
critical.  I have not called out any tap drill on tapped holes, only
the thread depth.
