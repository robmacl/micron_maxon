1 layer flex construction:
    1/2 oz copper preferred, but 1 oz would be acceptable for lower price.
    1 mil polyimide substrate and coverlay
    polyimide stiffener

If there is any change I could make to the design to reduce cost, let
me know.  This is for a dynamic flex application so I want to maintain
a balanced construction.
