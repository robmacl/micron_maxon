ASAP calibration ideas

 -- Move away from using Tsai calibrate.  Instead use Matlab
    lsqnonlin.
 -- Calibrate each sensor seperately keeping LED normal radial to lens
    center.  This minimizes contribution from probe error.
 -- Calibrate probe model separately before external parameters or
    simultaneously.
 -- Using lots of points minimizes effect of motion stage errors.
 -- Led pinhole mask.  Special small one for calibrate, rectangle for normal
    operation.
 -- Asap gain cal?  Probably submerged in psd nonlinearity.
