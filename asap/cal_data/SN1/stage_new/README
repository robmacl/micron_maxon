asap_lut.bin
calibration.dat
    These files are calibration products that are read by the labview code.
    Both files must be loaded onto the realtime target (in the root
    directory.)  asap_lut.bin is generated from calibration.dat by
    make_lut.vi.  calibration.dat is generated by
    micron/asap/matlab/calibrate.m, based on calibration_ref.dat and
    transform.mat.

calibration_ref.dat
    Output from Micron\motion\client\asap_calibration.vi during motion over 3D
    workspace.  This is an input to calibration.m.

sensor1_cal.dat
sensor2_cal.dat
    These files are also generated by asap_calibration.vi, but in a planar
    pattern where the probe is always oriented normal to the sensor.  These
    are the inputs to calibrate_sensors.m

transform.mat
    This file contains matlab variables that represent the results of
    calibration.  It propagates sensor calibration info from
    calibrate_sensors.m to calibrate.m and can also be used with
    check_calibration.m or for other matlab purposes.
